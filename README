This is an Acromania acronym game bot for IRC and SILC. This is old code I wrote back in 2008. I recently dug it up (in 2022) and added IRC support.

For IRC, it uses the "irc" library from pypi. you can probably install it with the command:

pip3 install irc

Then run it with:
./irc-bot.py <server[:port]> <channel> <nickname> <-ssl>

If you  need your bot to register with nickserv, create a file called mysecrets.py containing the line:

nickservRegString  = 'identify nick password'

Old readme from the archive:
